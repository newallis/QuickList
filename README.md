# QuickList
This project contains a Microsoft Access BE database,  Access FE database, and an Excel workbook. All contain fictional dummy data.  Tables in the BE were exported from queries and exports I designed in Blackbaud's The Raiser's Edge (note: fictional data is included in this project to protect anonymity). The FE database contains several queries that organize and manipulate the data into four main tables: Mailing List, Email List, Removed from Mailing List, and Removed from Email List.  This project contains an Excel workbook that connects to the four queries in the Access FE DB.  The workbook contains conditional formatting formulas that improves readability of the constituent data.  An Excel Macro is included to quickly delete columns of data that contained sensitive financial information in the case document sharing was necessary. This project met the organizations need for a quick list generation utility with a high standard for data integrity, accuracy, and standardization.
